# GstDots

Watches for GStreamer .dot files in a local path and displays them in a browser.

## How to use it

This tool uses the `GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR` environment variable to locate the dot
files generated by GStreamer.

```sh
export GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=/tmp/dots
```

Before starting the server, you need to install its dependencies.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Browse to `http://localhost:3000` and wait for the graphs to appear as you use your
GStreamer application. The web page is refreshed everytime a new .dot file is found
in the path pointed by the `GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR` env var.
